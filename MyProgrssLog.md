# 100DaysOfMLCode
## This Repository contains my progress of 100 days of machine learning journey. #100daysofmlcode
### Day 0: July 6,2018


**Today's Progress**: *  I have setup the environment. Installed the Python and anaconda for the same. I have learnt about machine learning and its types. Supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised. Real life examples and applcations of ML

**Thoughts:** I am very excited at the same time i am in little doubt that will i make through this journey. I have started one udemy course to learn about ML because before digging deep into the problem i have to enhance my basic knowledge.
